#Collaborative Development using Gitflow
 
Objective:
This assignment aims to develop your practical understanding of the Gitflow workflow in a simulated collaborative environment. You will gain hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, focusing on the fundamentals of version control in a team setting.
 
Task Overview:
Create a simple project using either simple text files or basic Java code examples. The project doesn't need to be complex; it's meant to simulate a real development environment.
Implement the Gitflow workflow in your project by creating multiple directories on your computer to simulate different collaborators. Use feature branches, a development branch, and a main branch appropriately. Perform at least one 'release' and one 'hotfix' during your project.
